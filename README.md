# **Capstone project: Providing data-driven suggestions for HR**

## Description and deliverables
In this capstone project, I will analyze a dataset and build predictive models to provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.   
For my deliverables, I will include the model evaluation (and interpretation if applicable), data visualizations directly related to the questions asked, ethical considerations, and the resources I used to troubleshoot and find answers or solutions.

## **Pace: Plan**
Considering the questions in the PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Plan stage, I will consider the following:
### Understand the business scenario and problem
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They have collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They have approached me, a data analytics professional, and requested data-driven suggestions based on my understanding of the data. They have a specific question: what’s likely to make an employee leave the company?   
My goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.   
If I can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their departure. Because finding, interviewing, and hiring new employees is time-consuming and expensive, increasing employee retention would be beneficial to the company.
### Familiarizing with the HR dataset

The dataset that T'll be using in this case study contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns for the variables listed below.
